Paste Installation
++++++++++++++++++

Installation of Paste-enabled applications is consistent and reliable;
you don't have to understand what technologies those applications
used.  Paste-enabled applications are installable with `easy_install
<>`_, like::

    $ easy_install FileBrowser
    ... messages ...

Once an application is installed, you can set up an instance of that
application with ``paste deploy``::

    $ paste deploy FileBrowser location
    ... @@: make this work ;) ...

This just wrote to ``location/filebrowser.ini`` -- you can configure
the application there, with whatever specifics that application needs.
Then you can integrate it into your website and other applications,
with a file like::

    [composit:main]
    use = egg:Paste#urlmap
    /browser = config:filebrowser.ini

You can attach applications to many locations using this.  Once you've
set that file up with your local settings and preferences, you can
run::

    $ paster serve location/apps.ini --daemon

And it will be running in the background.
