Introduction
============

Python Paste is a web application framework framework.  It uses WSGI_ 
to create a framework-neutral set of components.  It also assists with
application setup and deployment.

Paste includes a reimplementation of `Webware for Python`_.

.. _WSGI: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html

To check out Paste::

    $ svn co http://svn.w4py.org/Paste/trunk Paste

Note that it includes a script ``build-pkg`` which fetches a bunch of
packages that make Paste more useful.  A big tarball of all the
requirements stuffed together will probably be forthcoming.
