Paste Enabled
+++++++++++++

*Paste Enabled* means that a web application has a simple and
consistent means of installation and configuration.

What does this mean?  Well, here's how you install the code and
dependencies for a Paste Enabled application::

    easy_install ApplicationName

Here's the configure file to use that application::

    [app:main]
    use = egg:ApplicationName
    database = ...
    title = 

Once you've configured it, you can serve that application immediately
and directly (using a simple HTTP server), or you can run it under
SCGI, FastCGI, HTTP proxy, AJP, and other protocols.

If you want to run multiple applications on the same site, you just
create a mapping::

    [app:main]
    use = egg:Paste#urlmap
    /forum = config:forum.ini
    /contact = config:contact.ini

A Paste Enabled application can be embedded in other applications,
easily included in other websites, managed by simple startup/shutdown
scripts, and easily upgraded.  "Paste Enabled" means the application
is well encapsulated, ready for distribution and reuse, and easy to
manage.

When a **framework** is Paste Enabled, it means it helps you build
Paste Enabled applications.  A good framework should guide you through
the steps to 

Paste Enabled builds on other emerging standards like WSGI and Python
Eggs.
