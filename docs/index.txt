Python Paste brings consistency to Python web development and web
application installation, providing tools for both developers and
system administrators.

Paste for Administrators
------------------------

* Easily install, run, and configure multiple Paste-enabled web
  applications at once, and integrate them into your website how you
  want (SCGI, FCGI, AJP, WSGI)

* Manage and install web applications system-wide for easy maintenance

* `See an installation example <install-example.html>`_ or `read more
  about what Paste-enabled means... <enabled.html>`_

Paste for Web Developers
------------------------

* Increase your web application's audience

* Provide starter templates and custom commands for using your web
  framework

* Keep your development and deployment straightened out, and your
  automated testing streamlined

* Attention payed to the full development cycle -- starting projects,
  converting old projects, updating and deploying projects -- using a
  set of `complimentary packages and tools <related-projects.html>`_

* `See a development example <develop-example.html>`_ or `read more
  about using Paste in your
  applications... <developer-features.html>`_
