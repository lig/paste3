ROADMAP

Items to do
===========

- add checkboxes for done/not-done states

- by default, only show not-done items (with a toggle between done/not-done)

- give a link/page to see the completed items

- show the number of items (visually or textually) in a todo list

- move items from one list to another

- "share" a list, i.e. a read-only version for an unauthenticated?  user

- email a list

- see multiple lists at once

- "subscribe" to a list for status changes or reminders

- add due date, completion date and creation date to todo items

- nest-able todo lists? (a todo list could be contained in another?)

Bugs to fix
===========

- list names don't work with spaces in them... let's make it so they can

- /<username>/<listname>/delete doesn't work (can't delete/obliterate a list)
