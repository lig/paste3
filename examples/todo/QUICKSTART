WSGIKit Example Application: todo
=================================

This is a simple application intended to demonstrate the basic usage of
a WSGIKit site as well as some WSGI features such as a middleware hooks
that performs URL rewriting.

ROADMAP lists some of the features we intend to implement in the future.

Installing WSGIKit
------------------

`docs/WSGIKit.txt`__ describes a basic user-level installation of
WSGIKit and supported WSGI servers.

.. __: http://svn.w4py.org/WSGIKit/trunk/docs/WSGIKit.txt

Your First Run
--------------

The commands::

    cd WSGIKit/trunk
    wsgikit/server.py --server=wsgiutils --webkit-dir=example/todo \
        --port 8080 -D --data-dir='/var/www/data1'

If you do not have $PYTHONPATH set up as described WSGIKit.txt then you
can add a like such as this::

    env PYTHONPATH=`pwd` wsgikit/server.py ...

Replace 'env' with 'setenv' if you're using csh or tcsh.

Then open up http://localhost:8080/

Running Multiple Instances
--------------------------

Any options not defined in server.py are passed on to the application.
In the previous example --data-dir is an optional argument that
specifies where to put the todo list, which is a pickled instance of the
Manager class in model.py.

Simply specify an alternate --port and --data-dir to run multiple
instances simultaneously. The todo lists are saved to disk after each
modification to user accounts or lists and saved as state.pickle.

Testing
-------

There is a simple set of tests in examples/todo/tests that you can run
using py.test (see `PyPy doc`__ for information on how to set up py.test).
The tests only cover the logic contained in todo/model.py
